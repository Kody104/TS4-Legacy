                <h2>What is a "Legacy Challenge"?</h2>
                <p>The legacy challenge is a a set of rules that the player can choose to play with. The goal 
                    of the challenge is to start out in poverty and to build your family legacy over the next
                    10 generations. You must build your family home and make a name for your dynasty, starting 
                    from your founder and continuing from generation to generation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is a list of the most common rules that people use for their challenge!
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can only make one sim as the founder. The founder's age must be young adult.</li>
                    <li>Buy an empty lot without a house (known as the "legacy lot").</li>
                    <li>Use the money cheat to set your money to 0.</li>
                    <li>No cheats / exploits when the game has officially started.</li>
                    <li>You cannot move any sim into your family home unless they are your spouse/partner.</li>
                    <li>You cannot move out from your legacy home at any time.</li>
                    <li>Once a non-heir family member moves from the legacy house, they cannot come back.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What type of legacy playthrough is this tool for?</h2>
                <p>
                    This legacy challenge is called the <b>Unique Random Trait Challenge</b>. This challenge is 
                    similar to the <b>Random Legacy Challenge</b> rules, where each trait that your heir sim 
                    has is randomized. The additional rules that are added are that your played sim's 
                    traits cannot be the same as any previously played sim's trait in your bloodline. This 
                    means that any trait that your played sim has had at any point in the playthrough cannot 
                    be used for your next heir's traits. You can probably already see how unmanageable that 
                    would be in the latter half of your family's dynasty. This tool is designed to give you 
                    random traits for your sims to use, and it keeps track of any previously used trait in 
                    your played sim timeline!
